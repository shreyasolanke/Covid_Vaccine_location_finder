How to run the script?

You will find a file named - vaccine.jar
Install Java 8 runtime in your machine
in Terminal - java -jar vaccine.jar DistrictID <age(18/45)>
Eg. [java -jar vaccine.jar 265 18] (Bangalore Urban, 18+)
If it is run without param, there is a file app.prop, the districtID will be picked from there and default age will be 18
